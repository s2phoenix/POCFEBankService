# FE for test Bankservice

:D I create this by no fashion css. the main purpose for this project is how to apply generate Typescript and how to call it.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.11.

## Development server

install boostrap, bootstrap icon
```bash
npm install bootstrap bootstrap-icons
```
To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
